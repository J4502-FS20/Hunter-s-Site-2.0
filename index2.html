  <h1>Glossary & Things to Know</h1>
  <h2>Terms, statistics and facts that might be helpful to know</h2>

  <h3>General Terms</h3>
  <p> <b>Bullet:</b> contrary to what you may think you (maybe you already knew this) the bullet is actually just the projectile that a firearms shoots/projects from the firearm. When someone buys ammunition (unless they make their own) they aren’t actually just buying bullets but <b>Cartridges</b> (see term).</p>
  <p> <b>Cartridge:</b> so, the cartridge is both the bullet and the casing. The casing houses powder that is used as a propellant for the actual bullet. Depending on the type of firearm the “spent” cartridge may be ejected from the gun automatically (see <b>semi-automatic</b> & <b>automatic</b>). Conversely it may have to be extracted manually-- more on that later.</p>
  <p> <b>Rifle:</b> this is a broad term that I will go into further detail in a bit. From a legal standpoint a rifle is any firearm that has a barrel that is more than 16 inches. You may be thinking, wow, what a weird number? Well that just so happens to be the length that the Federal government and <b>Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms </b> decided on. Rifles can be everything from single-shot rifles to automatic assault rifles. The term is very broad and I’ll explain why soon.</p>
  <p> <b>Pistol:</b> much like Rifle-- is a very broad term. Pistols from a simple standpoint have a barrel less than 16 inches. This makes things very confusing from a reporting perspective. For example, an <b>AR15</b> (more on that later) pattern rifle that has a 15.9 inch barrel but has a “pistol” brace is legally not a rifle but a pistol. At the same time the term pistol also includes <b>revolvers</b> (like what you see in westerns) and traditional handguns that everybody can own from civilians to members of special forces. It is super broad and I’ll explain it all in a bit. </p>

  <h3>Types of pistols </h3>
  <p><b>Handgun (hammer-fired):</b>so a hammer-fired handgun is a pistol that uses a hammer to strike the primer to make the gun fire the projectile that is loaded inside of it. These guns are <b>semi-automatic </b> and have been around <b>since the late 1800s</b>. If you are legally allowed to buy a firearm in the U.S. you can buy these from nearly any place that sells firearms. They are incredibly common. Popular hammer-fired handguns include the 1911, Beretta 92 and the CZ-75. Common cartridges that you will see fired from these are: .22LR, .380, 9mm Luger, .40 S&W, .45 ACP and 10MM.</p>
  <p><b>Handgun (striker-fired):</b> So, unlike hammer-fired handguns, striker-fired handguns typically do not have an exposed hammer. Rather the primer for the cartridge is struck by a “striker” insider the handgun. Popular striker-fired handguns include the nearly all Glocks, Smith & Wesson Shield. Common cartridges that you will see fired from these are: .22LR, .380, 9mm Luger, .40 S&W, .45 ACP and 10MM.</p>
  <p><b>Revolver:</b> So, you know those guns that you normally see in westerns? The ones that have a cylinder? Those are revolvers. For the most part revolvers come in two varieties: <b>single-action</b> & <b>double-action</b>. <b>Single-action</b> revolvers require the user to manually pull back the hammer behind the cylinder every single time that they want to fire the revolver. <b>Double-action</b> revolvers don’t have to do this-whenever you pull the trigger on a <b>double-action</b> revolver it also rotates the cylinder readying the next hence “double-action.” Simple right? Common cartridges you will see for revolvers are: .357 magnum, .38 special, .44 magnum and .22LR/Magnum. These aren’t all of them but just the ones you will encounter the most from a statistics standpoint.</p>
  <h3> Adding More in Time but you get the idea. h3 tags for category. p tags for terms with key terms bolded. </h3>
